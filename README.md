# Automating GitHub with MCP

This repository provides instructions and tools for automating GitHub workflows and processes, extracting and analyzing data from GitHub repositories, and building AI-powered tools and applications that interact with GitHub's ecosystem.

## Prerequisites

To get started, ensure you have the following:

1. **Docker**: Install Docker on your system. You can download it from [Docker's official website](https://www.docker.com/).
2. **Running Docker**: Make sure Docker is running on your machine.
3. **GitHub Personal Access Token**: Create a GitHub Personal Access Token. The MCP server can use many of the GitHub APIs, so enable the permissions that you feel comfortable granting your AI tools. For more information, refer to [GitHub's documentation on personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token).

## Running the MCP Server

To run the server in a container, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -i --rm -e GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=<your_personal_access_token> ghcr.io/github/github-mcp-server
```

Replace `<your_personal_access_token>` with your actual GitHub Personal Access Token.
